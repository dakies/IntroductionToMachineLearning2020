Simple least squares with feature engineering, regularisation ...
## Project 2
Medical Event Prediction
Data: 12 hours per patient (time series), vital signs and test results
Subtask 1: Predict whether medical tests will be ordered 
Subtask 2: Predict whether sepsis will occur 
Subtask 3: predict future means of vital signs 

Here are some meta-data on the meaning and physical units of each variable in the data-set,
in the first paragraph the vital signs and EtCO2 is treated, in the second paragraph the
(laboratory) measurement tests.

'Temp' is the body temperature [Celsius]

'RRate' is the respiration rate of the patient [breath/min]

ABPm, ABPd, ABPs are the mean arterial, diastolic and systolic blood pressures of the patient [mmHg],

'Heartrate' is the number of heart beats per minute [heart beats/min],

'SpO2' is pulse oximetry-measured oxygen saturation of the blood [%].

'EtCo2' is the CO2 pressure during expiration [mmHg].


PTT: a test which measures the time it takes for a blood clot to form [sec.]

BUN: Blood urea nitrogen concentration [in mg per dl]

Lactate: Lactate acid concentration [in mg per dl]

Hgb: Haemoglobin concentration [g per dl]

HCO3: Bicarbonate concentration [mmol per l]

BaseExcess: Base excess measured in a blood gas analysis [mmol per l]

Fibrinogen: A protein produced by the liver. This protein helps stop bleeding by helping blood clots to form. Concentration [mg per dl]

Phosphate: Phosphate concetration [mg per dl]

WBC: White blood cell count in blood [number of 1000s per microliter]

Creatinine: Serum creatinine concentration used to determine renal function [mg per dl]

PaCO2: Partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood [mmHg] indicates effectiveness of lung function

AST: Aspartate transaminase, a clinical test determining liver health [International unit per liter, biological activity]

FiO2: Fraction of inspired oxygen in %

Platelets: Thromocyte count in blood [numbers of 1000s per microliter]

SaO2: Oxygen saturation in arterial blood analyzed with blood gas analysis [%]

Glucose: Concentration of serum glucose [in mg per dl]

Magnesium: Concentration of magnesium in blood [mmol per dl]

Potassium: Concentration of potassium in blood [mmol per liter]

Calcium: Concentration of calcium in blood [mg per dl]

Alkalinephos: Biological activity of the enzyme Alkaline phosphotase [International unit per liter]

Bilirubin_direct: Bilirubin concentration of conjugated bilirubin [mg per dl]

Chloride: Chloride concentration in blood [mmol per l]

Hct: Volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood [%]

Bilirubin_total: Bilirubin concentration including conjugated / unconjugated bilirubin [mg per dl]

TroponinI: Concentration of troponin in the blood [ng per ml]

pH: Measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of the blood, with a standard unit for pH.
## Project 3
Wroking with spare and unbalanced data
## Project 4
Neural Networks
Create model to identify wich food tastes the most similar from a picture of 3 different foods. i.e. pictures -> potatoe fries, mashed potatoes & candy. output potatoe fries and mashed potatoes
